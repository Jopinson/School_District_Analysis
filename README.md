# School_District_Analysis
I was tasked with examining data for a school district. The data included all students, schools, reading and math scores, budgets. I used this script to preform an analysis on the district to determine the top preforming schools, average math and reading grades, and sort thru the data on a by grade level. Part way thru my analysis I was informed one school had shown evidence of academic misconduct and added code to change their scores to NaN.
