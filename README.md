# School_District_Analysis
I was tasked with examining data for a school district. The data included all students, schools, reading and math scores, budgets. I used this script to preform an analysis on the district to determine the top preforming schools, average math and reading grades, sort thru the data on a by grade level, and calculate the budget used per student. Part way thru my analysis I was informed one school had shown evidence of academic misconduct and added code to change their scores to NaN. 
## Findings

Before the evidence of academic dishonesty was recieved, Thomas High School was #2 in the top 5 preforming high schools.
