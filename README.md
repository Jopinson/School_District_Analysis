# School_District_Analysis
I was tasked with examining data for a school district. The data included all students, schools, school type, reading and math scores, and budgets. I used this script to preform an analysis on the district to determine the top preforming schools, average math and reading grades, sort thru the data on a by grade level, and calculate the budget used per student. Part way thru my analysis I was informed one school had shown evidence of academic dishonesty with their 9th grade class and so code was added to change their scores to NaN. 
## Findings

Before the evidence of academic dishonesty was recieved, Thomas High School was #2 in the top 5 preforming high schools in the district.

After the evidence was presented Thomas High School fell out of the top five. 
Overall, the academic dishonesty really only affected Thomas High Schools 9th grade, the top schools are all still charter schools and Thomas High School didn't even fall into the bottom 5 preforming school even with an entire grades scores as invalid!
